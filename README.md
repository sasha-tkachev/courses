# DB Course MMN11 Task
### Open University Nov 2019 Fall Semester 
This is my solving of the MMN11 task
## Usage
To test a specific query question under the d category use the make_test.bat script

For example if I want to test question 6 I will do
```bash
make_test 6
```
now I can execute the query found under `build/test_query.sql`

When I think all my questions are passing the manual test I can submit the questions using the make script

Make sure you are allowed to run powershell scripts 
```
make.ps1
```
Send to the task system the ready mmn uder `build/mmn11.zip`
